# random-dice

This is a fun random dice numbers generator I built ([watch the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AMPX-euDc&list=PLQTDXis1psVf7-Jr9vjne3_mMqjWPpsmu&index=4)) with Codex, without knowing JavaScript, and deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), by simply copy-pasting from the instructions.

## Tools I used building this
- [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/) for auto-generating JS code
- [Stenography](https://stenography.dev) for explaining the auto-generated code
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deploying
